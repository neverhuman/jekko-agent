# jekko-agent

Status badge marker: jankurai-badge.

jankurai, jankurai-runner, sandboxctl split out of the Jekko portal as an independently buildable Rust repository.

This repository is a standalone split-family checkout. It contains repo-local workspace members only; support crates copied from the portal are present under `crates/` so CI does not depend on sibling split repositories. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before editing.

## Quick Start

## Jankurai Score Flow

Jankurai writes `.jankurai/repo-score.{json,md}` first, then mirrors the same score files into `target/jankurai/` and tracked `agent/repo-score.{json,md}`. Score history remains in `.jankurai/` and is mirrored into `target/jankurai/`.
